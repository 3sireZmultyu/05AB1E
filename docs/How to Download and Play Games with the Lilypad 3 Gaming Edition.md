# How to Download and Play Games with the Lilypad 3 Gaming Edition
 
The Lilypad 3 Gaming Edition is a wearable device that lets you play interactive games using sensors, motors, LEDs, and wireless communication. It is based on the Lilypad 3, a programmable microcontroller board that can be sewn onto fabrics and integrated with other electronic components. The Lilypad 3 Gaming Edition comes pre-soldered and assembled, so you don't need to worry about wiring or soldering. You just need to download the games from the official website and upload them to your device using a USB cable.

In this article, we will show you how to download and play three different games with the Lilypad 3 Gaming Edition: Rock Paper Scissors, Simon Says, and Light Tag. These games are designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the Lilypad 3 Gaming Edition and to provide fun and engaging experiences for players of all ages.
 
## Rock Paper Scissors
 
Rock Paper Scissors is a classic game of chance where two players compete by choosing one of three hand gestures: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the following rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same gesture, it is a tie.
 
To play Rock Paper Scissors with the Lilypad 3 Gaming Edition, you need two devices and two players. Each device has three LEDs that correspond to the three gestures: red for rock, green for paper, and blue for scissors. Each device also has a button that allows the player to select their gesture. The devices communicate wirelessly using the LilyPad Xbee module, which is included in the kit.
 
To start the game, both players press their buttons simultaneously. The devices will then flash their LEDs randomly for a few seconds, creating a suspenseful effect. When the flashing stops, each device will show one LED that indicates the gesture chosen by the player. The devices will also compare their gestures and determine the winner. The winner's device will vibrate using a small motor, while the loser's device will make a buzzing sound using a piezo speaker. If both devices show the same gesture, it is a tie and no one wins.
 
To download Rock Paper Scissors for your Lilypad 3 Gaming Edition, go to [^1^] and click on the link for lilyPAD-3.2.zip. This file contains the code and instructions for all three games. Extract the zip file and open the folder called RockPaperScissors. Inside this folder, you will find two files: RockPaperScissors.ino and RockPaperScissors.h. These are the Arduino sketch files that contain the code for the game. To upload them to your device, you need to install the Arduino IDE software on your computer. You can download it for free from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.
 
Once you have installed the Arduino IDE software, connect your Lilypad 3 Gaming Edition to your computer using a USB cable. Open the Arduino IDE software and select Tools > Board > LilyPad Arduino USB from the menu. Then select Tools > Port > COM (LilyPad Arduino USB) from the menu. This will ensure that your computer can communicate with your device.
 
Next, open the RockPaperScissors.ino file in the Arduino IDE software. This file contains the main code for the game. Before uploading it to your device, you need to change one line of code that specifies which player you are: player 1 or player 2. To do this, find the line that says #define PLAYER\_NUMBER 1 and change it to #define PLAYER\_NUMBER 2 if you are player 2. Otherwise, leave it as it is.
 
Now you are ready to upload the code to your device. Click on Sketch > Upload from the menu or press Ctrl+U on your keyboard. The Arduino IDE software will compile and upload the code to your device. You should see a message saying "Done uploading" at the bottom of the window when it is finished.
 
Repeat these steps for the other device, making sure that you change the player number accordingly. Once both devices have been uploaded with the code, you can disconnect them from your computer and start playing Rock Paper Scissors with your friend!
