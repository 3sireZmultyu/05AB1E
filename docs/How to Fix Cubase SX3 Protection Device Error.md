There are several possible causes and solutions for this error. Here are some steps you can try to fix it:
 
1. Make sure you have the original dongle that came with your Cubase SX3 package. If you have lost or damaged it, you will need to contact Steinberg customer support and request a replacement. Do not use any illegal or unofficial dongles or emulators, as they may not work properly and may violate the software license agreement.
2. Make sure you have installed the latest version of the eLicense Control Center from the Steinberg website. This is the software that manages the dongle and the license. You can download it from [here](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies/elicenser.html). Install it with administrator privileges and without the dongle plugged in.
3. Plug in the dongle to a USB port on your computer. Avoid using any USB hubs or extensions, as they may interfere with the communication between the dongle and the software. Try different USB ports if possible.
4. Launch the eLicense Control Center and check if your dongle and your Cubase SX3 license are recognized. If not, try updating or repairing your license by following the instructions on [this page](https://helpcenter.steinberg.de/hc/en-us/articles/115000535804-Software-license-repair-with-eLicenser-Control-Center).
5. Launch Cubase SX3 and see if the error is gone. If not, try reinstalling Cubase SX3 with administrator privileges and without the dongle plugged in.

If none of these steps work, you may have a faulty dongle or a compatibility issue with your operating system or hardware. In that case, you will need to contact Steinberg customer support and provide them with your system information and error details. They will be able to assist you further.
