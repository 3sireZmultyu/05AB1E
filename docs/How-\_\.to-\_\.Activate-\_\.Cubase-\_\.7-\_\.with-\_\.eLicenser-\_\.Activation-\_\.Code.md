In this article, we will show you how to get and use an eLicenser Activation Code for Cubase 7, as well as how to avoid illegal downloads and cracks that may harm your system or compromise your security.
  
## What is an eLicenser Activation Code?
 
An eLicenser Activation Code is a 32-digit code that you need to enter in the eLicenser Control Center (eLCC) software to download and store the license for your Steinberg product. The eLCC software is installed automatically along with Cubase 7 and allows you to manage your licenses on a USB-eLicenser (dongle) or a Soft-eLicenser (virtual license container on hard disk).
 
An eLicenser Activation Code can have different sources depending on how you purchased Cubase 7:
 
- If you bought Cubase 7 in a box, it includes a Download Access Code printed on a sheet (Essential Product License Information). When you redeem the Download Access Code in the Steinberg Download Assistant, an eLicenser Activation Code will be automatically generated and used to download and activate your license[^1^].
- If you bought Cubase 7 as a download from the Steinberg online shop, you received a confirmation email with either an eLicenser Activation Code or a Download Access Code. If you received a Download Access Code, you need to redeem it in the Steinberg Download Assistant to get your eLicenser Activation Code[^1^].
- If you need to reactivate Cubase 7 after changing your computer or reinstalling your system, you can request an eLicenser Activation Code in your MySteinberg account. You need to register your product and enter your old Soft-eLicenser number to get a new eLicenser Activation Code by email[^1^].
- If you have an older version of Cubase LE, AI, or WaveLab LE that came with a hardware device or a magazine, you can register your product online in your MySteinberg account and get an eLicenser Activation Code for a permanent license by email[^1^].

## How to use an eLicenser Activation Code?
 
Once you have your eLicenser Activation Code, you can use it to activate Cubase 7 by following these steps:

1. Install Cubase 7 on your computer. You can download the installer from the Steinberg website or use the installation disc if you have one.
2. Install the latest update for Cubase 7 if available in the Steinberg Download Assistant or on the Steinberg download pages. Some installers allow you to include updates during the installation.
3. Open the eLCC software. You can find it under 'Program Files' (Windows) or 'Applications' (Mac OS X).
4. Apply the 'Maintenance & Online Synchronisation' by clicking on 'Perform Maintenance Tasks' (or click on the 'Maintenance' button at the top right if not shown). This will update your eLCC software and synchronize your licenses with the Steinberg server.
5. Click on the 'Enter Activation Code' button at the top left. This will open a dialog where you can enter your eLicenser Activation Code.
6. Enter your eLicenser Activation Code and click on 'Continue'. The license will be downloaded and stored either in the Soft-eLicenser (locally on hard disk) or on a connected USB-eLicenser (dongle), depending on the type of license[^1^].
7. Close the eLCC software and launch Cubase 7. You should be able to use it without any restrictions.
